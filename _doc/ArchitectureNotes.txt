cli 
  - It provides an entry point to launch the app locally via NPM
    - npx jbook2-msl serve
  - It depends on the commander package to behave just like other
    cli(s)    
  - It depends on the local-api. The reason that we list local-client
    in the dependencies in the package.json is for bundling purpose.
  - It Dev mode, you need to go to the dist folder to run the following
    - node index.js serve

local-api
  - In Prod mode, it launches an express server and loads the local-client 
    production build to the browser when you visit the site
  - In Dev mode, it just sends the requests to the Create React App 
    Dev server
  - In depends on local-client simply because it needs to figure out
    where the build folder is
  - It's responsible for saving cells to a local file      

local-client
  - calls APIs hosted in local-api
  - all dependencies are dev dependencies as users are running the 
    production build
  - In Dev mode, don't use the site launched from http://localhost:3000
    use the side launched from the cli instead as for example:
    http://localhost:4005. This is because APIs are hosted at the 
    local-api express server not the Create React App Dev server.
